## Setup the `Docker Server` and `Jenkins Server` for CICD Lab.

### Task 1: Manually launch the Jump Server EC2 Instance

* Region: North Virginia (us-east-1).
* Use tag Name: `sirin-Jump-Server`
* AMI Type and OS Version: `Ubuntu 22.04 LTS`
* Instance type: `t2.micro`
* Create key pair with name: `sirin-DevOps-Keypair`
* Create security group with name: `sirin-DevOps-SG`
   (Include Ports: `22 [SSH],` `80 [HTTP],` `8080 [Jenkins],` `9999 [Tomcat],` and `4243 [Docker]`)
* Configure Storage: 10 GiB
* Click on `Launch Instance.`


### Task 2: Installing Terraform onto `Jump Server` to automate the creation of 2 more EC2 instances.
Once the Jump Server is up and running, SSH into the machine using `MobaXterm` or `Putty` with the username `ubuntu` and do the following:

```
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname JumpServer
bash
```
```
sudo apt update
```
```
sudo apt install wget unzip -y
```
```
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.12.2/terraform_1.12.2_linux_386.zip
```
[Click here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) for Terraform's Latest Versions
```
unzip terraform_1.9.2_linux_amd64.zip
ls
```
```
sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin
```
```
rm terraform_1.9.2_linux_amd64.zip
```
```
terraform -v
```

### Task 3: Install Python 3, pip, AWS CLI, and Ansible on to Jump Server
Install Python 3 and the required packages:
```
sudo apt install python3-pip -y
```
Installing `AWS CLI`
```
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
```
Installing Ansible
```
sudo apt install ansible -y
```
For Authentication with AWS we need to provide `IAM User's CLI Credentials`
```
aws configure
```
Once configured, do a smoke test to check if your credentials are valid and got the access to AWS account.
```
aws s3 ls
```
(Or)
```
aws iam list-users
```

### Task 4: Create a host inventory file with the necessary permissions (Ansible need this Inventory file for identifying the targets)
```
sudo mkdir /etc/ansible && sudo touch /etc/ansible/hosts
```
Change the permissions. The below command gives `Read, Write and Execute` permissions to `Owner,` `Read and Write` permissions to the `Group,` and `Read and Write` permissions to `Others.`
```
sudo chmod 766 /etc/ansible/hosts
```
Cross verify using the below command
```
ls -la /etc/ansible/
```

### Task 5: Utilizing Terraform, initiate the deployment of two new servers: `Docker-server` and `Jenkins-server` 

As a first step, create a keyPair using `ssh-keygen` Command.

**Note:**
1. This will create `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` in Jump Machine in `/home/ubuntu/.ssh/` path.
2. While creating choose defaults like:
   * path as **/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa**
   * don't set up any passphrase, and just hit the '**Enter**' key for 3 questions it asks.
3. `-t rsa:` Specifies the type of key to create, in this case, RSA.
4. `-b 2048:` Specifies the number of bits in the key, 2048 bits in this case. The larger the number of bits, the stronger the key.
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e81febd-047c-46e6-9c6b-1e9056613866)

Now Create the terraform directory and set up the config files in it
```
mkdir devops-labs && cd devops-labs
```
```
vi main.tf
```
Copy and paste the below code into `main.tf`
```
provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
}

resource "aws_key_pair" "mykeypair" {
  key_name   = var.key_name
  public_key = file(var.public_key)
}

# to create 2 EC2 instances
resource "aws_instance" "my-machine" {
  # Launch 2 servers
  for_each = toset(var.my-servers)

  ami                    = var.ami_id
  key_name               = var.key_name
  vpc_security_group_ids = [var.sg_id]
  instance_type          = var.ins_type
  depends_on             = [aws_key_pair.mykeypair]

  # Read from the list my-servers to name each server
  tags = {
    Name = each.key
  }

  # Ensure the .ssh directory exists before copying the file
  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    connection {
      type        = "ssh"
      user        = "ubuntu"
      private_key = file("/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa")  # Replace with the path to your private key
      host        = self.public_ip
    }

    inline = [
      "mkdir -p /home/ubuntu/.ssh"   # Ensure .ssh directory exists before copying the file
    ]
  }

  provisioner "file" {
    source      = "/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa"   # Source path on Host machine
    destination = "/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa"  # Destination path on EC2 instance
    connection {
      type        = "ssh"
      user        = "ubuntu"
      private_key = file("/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa")  # Replace with the path to your private key
      host        = self.public_ip
    }
  }

  # After the file is copied, change its permissions
  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    connection {
      type        = "ssh"
      user        = "ubuntu"
      private_key = file("/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa")  # Replace with the path to your private key
      host        = self.public_ip
    }

    inline = [
      "chmod 400 /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa"  # Change the permissions of the copied file after it's been transferred
    ]
  }

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = <<-EOT
      echo [${each.key}] >> /etc/ansible/hosts
      echo ${self.public_ip} >> /etc/ansible/hosts
    EOT
  }
}
```
Now, create the variables file with all variables to be used in the `main.tf` config file.
```
vi variables.tf
```
```
### **Note:** Change the following Inputs in `variables.tf.`

### Edit the **Allocated Region** (**Ex:** ap-south-1) & **AMI ID** of same region,
### Replace the same **Security Group ID** Created for the Jump Server
### Add your Name for **KeyPair** ("**YourName**-CICDlab-KeyPair")

variable "region" {
    default = "us-east-1"
}

# Change the SG ID. You can use the same SG ID used for your CICD Jump server
# Basically the SG should open ports 22, 80, 8080, 9999, and 4243
variable  "sg_id" {
    default = "sg-02b8781c33d6f584d" # us-east-1
}

# Choose a free tier Ubuntu AMI. You can use below. 
variable "ami_id" {
    default = "ami-0e86e20dae9224db8" # us-east-1; Ubuntu
}

# We are only using t2.micro for this lab
variable "ins_type" {
    default = "t2.micro"
}

# Replace 'yourname' with your first name
variable key_name {
    default = "sirin-Jenkins-Docker-KeyPair"
}

variable public_key {
    default = "/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"   #Ubuntu OS
}

variable "my-servers" {
  type    = list(string)
  default = ["sirin-Jenkins-Server", "sirin-Docker-Server"]
}
```
Now, execute the terraform commands to launch the new servers
```
terraform init
```
```
terraform plan
```
```
terraform apply -auto-approve
```
Once the Changes are Applies, Go to `EC2 Dashboard` and check that `2 New Instances` are launched. Also check the `inventory file` and ensure the below output.
```
cat /etc/ansible/hosts
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b882382f-ba8b-4ca1-b9e7-a96bdbf664a9)


### Task 6: Check the access from `Jump Server to Jenkins` and `Jump Server to Docker`

From `Jump Server` SSH into `Jenkins-Server`, check they are accessible.

```
ssh ubuntu@<Jenkins ip address>
```
Set the hostname
```
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname Jenkins
bash
```
```
sudo apt update
```
Exit from the Jenkins server
```
exit
```
```
exit
```

Now from `Jump Server` SSH into `Docker-Server` and check they are accessible.
```
ssh ubuntu@<Docker ip address>  
```
Set the hostname as
```
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname Docker
bash
```
```
sudo apt update
```
Exit only from the Docker Server, not the Jump Server.
```
exit
```
```
exit
```


### Task 7: Use `Ansible` to deploy respective packages onto each of the servers 
In Jump Server Create a directory and change to it
```
cd ~ && mkdir ansible && cd ansible
```
Now, Create a playbook, which will deploy packages onto the `Docker-server` and `Jenkins-Server.` For this Create a new File with the name `main.yaml.`
```
vi main.yaml
```
Copy and paste the below code and save it.
```

```
http://<Your_Jenkins_IP>:8080/
```
Verify the Docker Landing Page: Open a web browser and access the Docker landing page using your Docker server's public IP address. Replace `<Your_Docker_IP>` with the actual public IP.
